# 136. Single Number

'''
Task:
-----
Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4
-3 * 10^4 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 10^4
Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.

# Testcase:
-----------
[2,2,1]
[4,1,2,1,2]
[1]


# Code:
-------
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        
'''
# Solution
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        single_number = 0
        for num in nums:
            single_number ^= num
        return single_number
