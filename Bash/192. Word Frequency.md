# 192. Word Frequency.

## Topic: Shell.


### Task:

Write a bash script to calculate the frequency of each word in a text file words.txt.

For simplicity sake, you may assume:

    - words.txt contains only lowercase characters and space ' ' characters.
    - Each word must consist of lowercase characters only.
    - Words are separated by one or more whitespace characters.

**Example:**

Assume that words.txt has the following content:
```
the day is sunny the the
the sunny is is
```

Your script should output the following, sorted by descending frequency:
```
the 4
is 3
sunny 2
day 1
```

**Note:**
   - Don't worry about handling ties, it is guaranteed that each word's frequency count is unique.
   - Could you write it in one-line using Unix pipes?

### Code:
```
# Read from the file words.txt and output the word frequency list to stdout.
```

---

### Solution:

```bash

#!/bin/bash

cat words.txt | tr -s ' ' '\n' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | awk '{print $2, $1}'

```

### Description: 

To create a Bash script that calculates the frequency of each word in a text file (`words.txt`), and outputs 
the result sorted by descending frequency, we can utilize a combination of Unix commands such as `cat`, `tr`, 
`sort`, `uniq`, and `awk`. Here's a one-liner Bash script that accomplishes this task:

Let's break down this script:

1. `cat words.txt`: This command reads the content of `words.txt`.

2. `tr -s ' ' '\n'`: This translates all spaces to newlines (`\n`). The `-s` option squeezes each sequence of a 
    repeated character that is listed in the last specified SET, replacing it with a single occurrence of that character.

3. `sort`: This sorts the words. It's necessary because `uniq` (next command) only removes consecutive duplicate lines.

4. `uniq -c`: This counts (`-c`) the unique instances of each word.

5. `sort -nr`: This sorts the output numerically (`-n`) in reverse order (`-r`), so the most frequent words are at the top.

6. `awk '{print $2, $1}'`: This reformats the output to show the word first and then the count.

> My brethren! :) Please, place this script in a file, and make sure to give it execute permissions (with `chmod +x scriptname.sh`). 
> Run the script in a shell, and it will process `words.txt` as per the described requirements. Good luck !!!
