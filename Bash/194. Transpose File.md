# 194. Transpose File.

## Topic: Shell


### Task:


Given a text file file.txt, transpose its content.

You may assume that each row has the same number of columns, and each field is separated by the ' ' character.

Example:

If file.txt has the following content:
```
    name age
    alice 21
    ryan 30
```
Output the following:
```
    name alice ryan
    age 21 30
```

### Code:
```
# Read from the file file.txt and print its transposed content to stdout.
```

---

### Solution: 


```bash

#!/bin/bash
awk '
{
    for (i = 1; i <= NF; i++) {
        if(NR == 1) {
            transposed[i] = $i;
        } else {
            transposed[i] = transposed[i] " " $i;
        }
    }
}
END {
    for (i = 1; i <= NF; i++) {
        print transposed[i];
    }
}' file.txt

```


### Description: 
---

To transpose the contents of a text file (`file.txt`) in a shell environment, you can use a combination of Unix commands such as `awk`. 

Explanation:

1. `awk` is used to process the text file. It reads the file line by line.

2. In the main block `{ ... }`, it iterates over each field (`$i`) in a row. `NF` is the number of fields in the current row, and `NR` 
   is the current record number (line number).

3. For each field, it checks if it's the first row (`NR == 1`). If so, it initializes the `transposed` array with the first row's contents. 
   Otherwise, it appends the current field to the existing value in the `transposed` array.

4. In the `END` block, after processing all lines, it prints each element of the `transposed` array, which now contains the transposed data.

This script will read from `file.txt` and print its transposed content to stdout.
