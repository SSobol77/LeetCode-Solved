# 195. Tenth Line

## Topic: Shell

---
### Task:

Given a text file file.txt, print just the 10th line of the file.

Example:

Assume that file.txt has the following content:

```
Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
Line 4
Line 5
Line 6
Line 7
Line 8
Line 9
Line 10
```

Your script should output the tenth line, which is:

Line 10

**Note:**
1. If the file contains less than 10 lines, what should you output?
2. There's at least three different solutions. Try to explore all possibilities.

#### Code:
  *Read from the file file.txt and output the tenth line to stdout.*

### Solutions:

Bash scripts for each of the three methods to print the 10th line of a text file:

### Method 1: Using `sed`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Script to print the 10th line of a file using sed

sed -n '10p' file.txt
```

### Method 2: Using `awk`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Script to print the 10th line of a file using awk

awk 'NR == 10' file.txt
```

### Method 3: Using `head` and `tail`
The issue is that your script outputs a message when the file has fewer than 10 lines, but based on your requirement, it should output nothing in this case. The solution is to simply remove the `else` clause that prints the message. Here's the revised script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Count the number of lines in the file
line_count=$(wc -l < file.txt)

# Check if the line count is greater than or equal to 10
if [ "$line_count" -ge 10 ]; then
    # If so, print the 10th line
    head -n 10 file.txt | tail -n 1
fi
```

In this version, if the file has fewer than 10 lines, the script will do nothing and produce no output, which should meet the requirements of your test cases.
