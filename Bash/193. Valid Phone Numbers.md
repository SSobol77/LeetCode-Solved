# 193. Valid Phone Numbers.

## Topic: Shell.

### Task:

Given a text file file.txt that contains a list of phone numbers (one per line), write a one-liner bash script 
to print all valid phone numbers.

You may assume that a valid phone number must appear in one of the following two formats: (xxx) xxx-xxxx or xxx-xxx-xxxx. 
(x means a digit)

You may also assume each line in the text file must not contain leading or trailing white spaces.

**Example:**

Assume that file.txt has the following content:
```
987-123-4567
123 456 7890
(123) 456-7890
```
Your script should output the following valid phone numbers:
```
987-123-4567
(123) 456-7890
```

### Code:
```
# Read from the file file.txt and output all valid phone numbers to stdout.
```

### Solution:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
grep -P '^(\(\d{3}\) \d{3}-\d{4}|\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4})$' file.txt

```


### Description: 

To create a one-liner Bash script that filters out valid phone numbers from a text file (`file.txt`), you can use `grep` 
with a regular expression that matches the specified phone number formats. 

**Explanation:**

1. `grep -P`: This uses `grep` with the `-P` option, which tells `grep` to interpret the pattern as a Perl regular expression.

2. The regular expression `'^(\(\d{3}\) \d{3}-\d{4}|\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4})$'` is used to match valid phone numbers. Let's break it down:

   - `^`: Asserts the start of a line.
   - `\(\d{3}\) \d{3}-\d{4}`: Matches the format `(xxx) xxx-xxxx`.
     - `\(` and `\)` match the literal parentheses.
     - `\d{3}` matches exactly three digits.
     - A space (` `) follows the area code.
     - `\d{3}-\d{4}` matches three digits, a hyphen, and four digits.
   - `|`: Logical OR operator, separating the two possible formats.
   - `\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}`: Matches the format `xxx-xxx-xxxx`.
   - `$`: Asserts the end of a line.

This script reads from `file.txt` and outputs all valid phone numbers to stdout, according to the specified formats.
