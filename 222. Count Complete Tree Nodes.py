# 222. Count Complete Tree Nodes

'''
Task:
-----

Given the root of a complete binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.
According to Wikipedia, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, 
and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last 
level h.

Design an algorithm that runs in less than O(n) time complexity.

Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: 6

Example 2:
Input: root = []
Output: 0

Example 3:
Input: root = [1]
Output: 1
 
Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5 * 104].
0 <= Node.val <= 5 * 104
The tree is guaranteed to be complete.
